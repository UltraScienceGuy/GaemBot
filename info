# GaemBot
A discord bot that is still a WIP. As of 7/10/20, it is still a WIP, and must be locally hosted on your own PC.

# GaemBot is on v1.7, and includes:

Server moderation (role reactions, creating roles, kicking and banning)
Comics (displays comics)
Machine-Learning based Chatbot (can reply to messages, user is also able to change intents.json to what they please)
Funny vid (grabs a funny video from youtube)
8ball (randomly replies to a user's questions with an 8ball answer)
Uno (WIP almost there, but once finished, it will allow for the user to start an uno game, with the bot dealing cards and drawing for users).

# Future code initiatives:

Time gamed (Shows how long a user has played that game in a day, also able to see cumulative time gamed for a game.)
